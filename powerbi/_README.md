# Power BI Project
This project was created to allow data analysts and BI developers an opportunity to demonstrate their competency in building a Power BI dashboard. The data required to complete this exercise are located in the https://github.com/cofoid/dataskillscheck/tree/main/data/retail directory. 

If you have not already downloaded Power BI Desktop, you may do so by following this link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494

This project will allow you to demonstrate competency in:
* loading data
* creating a basic data model
* representing information visually

## Prompt
You are working for a retail clothing company (LFD) that is headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA and has stores spread across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. LFD has two chains (Fashions Direct and Lindseys). The company has sub-divided its stores into districts, each with its own district manager. LFD has recently opened some new stores as it tries to expand, but the store openings are off to a rocky start.

Management currently receives a series of reports that it uses to assess the performance of LFD and its district managers. While LFD has used these reports for years, they had difficulty using them to decipher whether the new stores were successful or not. They have hired you to help them build out a modern dashboard system to make it easier to understand how their stores and district managers are performing.

Your role is to integrate the data into a single, usable dashboard. (The dashboard may span multiple pages but be sure that your users can figure out how and when they should move to a new page!) This dashboard should help management assess the performance of each chain, district manager, store, product line and product. From the perspective of LFD’s management, more sales are good but more profit is better. 

Once you have completed the dashboard, you will need to present it to management, along with a summary of your findings. Your findings should give management a sense of the types of insights they can draw from your dashboard, highlighting how the dashboard is an improvement over their existing reports. 

## Data
There are five data files you will be provided for this exercise. You may load them in whatever manner you wish, and you may not need to load all of the files to complete the exercise. There are three different file formats; part of the exercise will be figuring out what format each file is in, loading it into Power BI, and (possibly) converting the file so it can be loaded into Power BI. The data provided cover the months from January 2014 through August 2014. 
•	Retail.district.txt
•	Retail.sales.tsv
•	Retail.item.tsv
•	Retail.store.csv
•	Retail.time.tsv
